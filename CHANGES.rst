Changelog
=========

1.6.0 (2022-09-13)
------------------

- Add ``zest.pocompile.available``.
  You can use this to let the full release of a package fail early when ``zest.pocompile`` is not available.
  Edit its ``setup.cfg``, and add a ``[zest.releaser]`` section with value
  ``prereleaser.before = zest.pocompile.available``

1.2 (2011-12-16)
----------------

- Added a larger example of a MANIFEST.in file in the readme.  Also
  add a MANIFEST.in in zest.pocompile itself, so the CHANGES.txt is
  included in the source distribution.

1.1 (2011-12-15)
----------------

- Look for ``.po`` files in any ``LC_MESSAGES`` directory.  It no
  longer matters if this is contained in a language directory within a
  ``locales`` or ``locale`` directory, as they could also have names
  like ``plonelocales`` or ``locales_for_version_2_only``.  Note that
  in Plone ``.po`` files can also be in an i18n directory, but those
  should not be compiled; this does not have a ``LC_MESSAGES``
  directory, so we automatically skip it.
