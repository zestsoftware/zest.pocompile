Changelog
=========

1.1 (unreleased)
----------------

- Look for ``.po`` files in any directory that has 'locale' in its name.
  No longer not restrict ``.po`` file search to directories explicitly
  named ``locales`` or ``locale``, as they could also have names like
  ``plonelocales`` or ``locales_for_version_2_only``.  Note that in
  Plone ``.po`` files can also be in an i18n directory, but those
  should not be compiled.
