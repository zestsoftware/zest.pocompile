1.1 (2011-12-15)
----------------

- Look for ``.po`` files in any ``LC_MESSAGES`` directory.  It no
  longer matters if this is contained in a language directory within a
  ``locales`` or ``locale`` directory, as they could also have names
  like ``plonelocales`` or ``locales_for_version_2_only``.  Note that
  in Plone ``.po`` files can also be in an i18n directory, but those
  should not be compiled; this does not have a ``LC_MESSAGES``
  directory, so we automatically skip it.
